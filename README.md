# Training, MOOCs, Certifications...
Here you will find all the courses and certifications I've taken in the past.

I'm quite curious and I'm constantly learning new technologies. You may think that most of them are already forgot. That's actually true. This is not about the knowledge I have. The real pourpose of this repo is to show my personality: how curious I am, how I want to get new knowledge, how do I take action... . Another goal of this repo is to show that maybe the knowledge is forgotten, but If I've been able to learn it once, it will be easier to learn it again.
